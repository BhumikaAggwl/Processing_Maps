# Processing_Maps

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks and data files for analyzing and visualizing processing maps of stainless steels (304, 304L, 316, 316L).

## Features

- Data files for different stainless steel grades (`.xlsx`, `.csv`)
- Jupyter Notebooks for:
  - Data cleaning and processing
  - Visualization of processing maps

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/BhumikaAggwl/Processing_Maps.git
cd Processing_Maps
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.  
Install the required packages:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```


### 3. Run the Notebooks

Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:


Open the desired `.ipynb` file (e.g., `304_ascast.ipynb`, `processing_maps_304L.ipynb`, or `316L_file.ipynb`) and run the cells.
